# Custom templates for Google Tag Manager
In this repository, I intend to collect [custom template files](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/custom-templates-guide-for-google-tag-manager/) for [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/).

# Instructions
To import a template file into your Google Tag Manager container, follow these steps:

1. Download the `.tpl` file you want to import.
2. Create a new **template** in Google Tag Manager (either *tag* or *variable*, depending on which type you are importing).
3. In the action menu in the top right corner of the template editor, choose **Import**.
4. Select the `.tpl` file from your container.

Importing a template file like this always **overwrites** any work you might have done in the underlying template, so you should always import to a newly created template.

# Taxonomy
Templates are organized by type (**tag** or **variable**).

Tag templates are organized by brand (e.g. **Facebook**), and then by template name.

Variable templates are organized by template name.
